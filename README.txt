This project aims to present a systematic comparison of EPR models to produce synthetic trajectories of human mobility, reproducing the movements of an individual in a realistic manner. 3 variants of this model are presented:

- Spatial EPR: Variant where individuals are constrained to move in a defined geographical space, given by a certain tessellation.
- Density EPR: Improving on the basic EPR model by using collective information and the gravity model to influence the decisions of an individual. The model thus exploits information about the relevance of locations within the given space, individuals are inclined to explore new places with a force depending on the relevance of such places at a collective level.
